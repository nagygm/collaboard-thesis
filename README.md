# Summary
* This is a basic collaborative drawing application to complete my bachelor degree.

## Technologies and frameworks:
* Spring Framework (Boot, Core, Data, Messaging, Websocket) https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/
* Fabric.js (http://fabricjs.com/) as the default board framework
* Stomp.js https://github.com/jmesnil/stomp-websocket for websocket messaging
* Sock.js https://github.com/sockjs for websocket connection management and fallback
* Databases: MongoDb -> saving board data only and MariaDb for everything else
